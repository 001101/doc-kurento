What is Kurento
---------------
**Kurento** is a WebRTC media server and a set of client APIs making simple the
development of advanced video applications for WWW and smartphone platforms.
Kurento features include group communications, transcoding, recording, mixing,
broadcasting and routing of audiovisual flows.

Kurento also provides advanced media processing capabilities involving computer
vision, video indexing, augmented reality and speech analysis. Kurento modular
architecture makes simple the integration of third party media processing
algorithms (i.e. speech recognition, sentiment analysis, face recognition,
etc.), which can be transparently used by application developers as the rest of
Kurento built-in features.

Kurento's core element is **Kurento Media Server**, responsible for media
transmission, processing, loading and recording. It is implemented in low level
technologies based on [GStreamer] to optimize the resource consumption.
