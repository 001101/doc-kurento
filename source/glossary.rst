    KAS
    **Kurento Application Server**
        A Java EE Application container that hosts the server side
        :term:`signalling plane` of Kurento applications. Currently
        Kurento support the use of `JBoss 7 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WildFly>`__.

    KMF
    **Kurento Media Framework**
        Framework for the development of rich media based applications.

    KMS
    **Kurento Media Server**
        The server that processes and runs the
        :term:`Media Pipeline <pipeline, media>` in Kurento.

    Media Plane
        In the traditional 3GPP Mobile Carrier `Media Framework
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Multimedia_Subsystem>`__,
        the handling of media is conceptually splitted in two layers.
        The one that handles the media itself, with functionalities such as
        media transport, encoding/decoding, and processing, is called
        :index:`Media Plane <single: Plane; Media>`.

    Pad, Media
        A :index:`Media Pad <single: Media; Pad>` is is an element´s
        interface with the outside world. Data streams from the MediaSource
        pad to another element’s MediaSink pad.

    Pipeline, Media
        A :index:`Media Pipeline <single: Media; Pipeline>` is a chain of media elements, where the output
        stream generated by one element (source) is fed into one or
        more other elements input streams (sinks). Hence, the pipeline
        represents a “machine” capable of performing a sequence of
        operations over a stream.

    SDP
    Session Description Protocol
        The `Session Description Protocol <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol>`__
        describes initialization parameters for a streaming media session.

    Signalling Plane
        It is the layer of a media system in charge of the information exchanges
        concerning the establishment and control of the different media circuits
        and the management of the network, in contrast to the transfer of media,
        done by the :index:`Signalling Plane <single: Plane; Signalling>`.

        Functions such as media negotiation, QoS parametrization, call establishment,
        user registration, user presence, etc. as managed in this plane.

    Sink, Media
        A :index:`Media Sink <single: Media; Sink>` is a MediaPad that outputs a Media Stream.  
        Data streams from a MediaSource pad to another element’s MediaSink pad.

    Source, Media
        A :index:`Media Source <single: Media; Source>` is a Media Pad that generates a Media Stream.
