In order to assess Kurento, a rich test suite has been designed and implemented. To that aim, the Kurento Testing Framework (KTF) was created. KTF is a part of the Kurento project aimed to carry out end-to-end (E2E) tests for Kurento. KTF has been implemented on the top of two well-known open-source testing frameworks: JUnit and Selenium.
