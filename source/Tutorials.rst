This section shows how to use Kurento by means of working demos. The code of these demos is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/Kurento>`_. These demos are the following:

- Loopback video call with filtering. This web application consists on a WebRTC communication in mirror, i.e., a media loopback.
- One to one video call. This web application is similar to a phone, but with also with video. It is also based on WebRTC.
- One to one video call with advanced features (recording and filtering). This is an enhanced version of the previous application. It uses media capabilities provided by the Kurento Media Server: the recording of the video communication, and also an augmented reality filter. Concretely, it is a face overlay filter. This filter detects face in the media, and overlays an image over the detected faces.  
- Group (many to many) video call. Web application based on WebRTC to communicate several peers.  
- Group (many to many) video call with advanced features (recording and filtering). Enhanced version of the previous demo, with recording and filtering capabilities.

As a developer, you can create applications using Kurento using Java, JavaScript, and Node.js. The following table summarizes these demos for each technology:
