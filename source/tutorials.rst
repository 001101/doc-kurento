This section shows how to use Kurento framework to build different types
applications with live audio and video. We will show several working
applications implemented with **Java**, **Browser JavaScript** and **Node.js**.

Tutorial 1 - Hello World
========================

This is one the simplest application you can create with Kurento. It is a web
application in which there is an `WebRTC`:term: video communication in mirror
(*loopback*).

Tutorial 2 - Magic Mirror
=========================

This web application consists on a `WebRTC`:term: video communication in mirror
adding a funny hat over your face. This is an example of augmented reality
using a filter.

Tutorial 3 - One to many video call
===================================

Video broadcasting web application based on `WebRTC`:term: technology. One peer
transmit a video stream and N peers receives that video.

Tutorial 4 - One to one video call
==================================

This web application is a videophone (call one to one) based on `WebRTC`:term:
technology.

Tutorial 5 - One to one video call with recording and filtering
===============================================================

This is an enhanced version of the previous application. It uses the following
Kurento capabilities: the recording of the video communication, and also an
augmented reality filter.

   Tutorial 7 - Group video call with recording and filtering
   ==========================================================

   Enhanced version of the previous demo, with recording and filtering capabilities.

   Tutorial: Java, Node.js, Browser JavaScript


   Tutorial 8 - HTTP Player
   ========================

   Play of a video through HTTP.
