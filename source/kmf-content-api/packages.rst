Introduction
============

The Kurento Content API (`javadoc <../_static/index.html?com/kurento/kmf/content/package-summary.html>`__)
is a Java EE layer which consumes the :doc:`Kurento Media API 
</kmf-media-api/packages>` and exposes its capabilities through
a simple modularity based on two types of objects:
`ContentHandlers` and `ContentSessions`.

A :java:type:`ContentHandler` is an abstraction extending the :term:`Java EE`
Servlet API. It enables the development of :term:`multimedia` applications
by managing the reaction to signalling events that happen during a session
(e.g. :java:meth:`onContentRequest`, :java:meth:`onContentTerminated`, etc.).

A :java:type:`ContentSession` represents a specific client application
accessing to the infrastructure and has an associated state. The
Content API is a :term:`signalling plane` API, which makes possible
to react to signalling messages received from the client and to execute
the appropriate application logic (e.g. authenticate, connect to a database,
execute a web service, use the :doc:`Media API  </kmf-media-api/packages>`,
etc.) at the appropriate instants. Content API developers require a
Java EE compatible Application Server.
